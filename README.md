6. [Mutations](mutations.py) - This program inputs a given string, position and new character. The string is modified at position to have the new character and new string printed.
7. [String is-a](string_isa.py) - This program checks if a given string is composed of alphanumeric characters, alphabetic characters, digits, uppercase or lowercase characters and prints true or false for each category.

10. [Text Wrap](text_wrap.py) - This program wraps a given string by the width inputted and prints the wrapped string using textwrap fill method.
11. [Find Angle MBC](find_angle.py) - This program finds angle MBC given the length of sides AB and BC for a triangle ABC with midpoint M from angle B to side AC. It rounds the calculated angle to the nearest integer and prints it as Â°.
12. [Ordered Dictionary](ordered_dictionary.py) - This program inputs number of items for a supermarket and also inputs the item names and prices and displays the items and net prices using Ordered Dictionaries from collections.
13. [Merge the tools](merge_the_tools.py) - This program inputs a string and substring 
size k and splits the string into size of k and displays only distinct characters in
substring. Uses textwrap.wrap and dictionary.setdefault methods
