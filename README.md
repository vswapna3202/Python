20. [Student Grade](grade.py) - This program prints the name(s) of students who scored
the second lowest score in ascending order. Uses set and nested lists.
21. [Student Marks](student_marks.py) - This program accepts n number of students name and their marks and for a particular student input by the user calculates the average of the marks and displays it.
22. [List Operations](list.py) - This perform accepts number of commands and performs
the commands on a list
23. [Tuples](hash.py) - This program accepts n which number of elements in a tuple and 
also all the elements in the tuple and performs hash on the tuple and prints it.
24. [Split-and-Join](split_join.py) - This program accepts a string separated with spaces and displays the same string separated with hyphens (-)
25. [Designer Doormat](designer_doormat.py) - This program prints a designer doormat with a welcome sign in the middle and accepts the size of the door mat as N and M integers where N is odd and M is 3 times of N.
26. [Word Order](words.py) - This program accepts n which are number of words and for
each word finds the number of occurences and also displays total number of words. Uses Ordered Dictionary from collections
27. [Itertools](itertools_comb_with_replacement.py) - This program accepts string S and integer k and prints all possible k combinations of string S in lexicographic sorted order. Uses itertools.combination_with_replacement
28. [Itertools](itertools_product.py) - This program accepts inputs of list A and list B and computes the cartesian product of list A and B and prints it as space separated tuples. Uses itertools.product
29. [Itertools](itertools_permutations.py) - This program accepts input string S and integer k and prints all k possible permutations of string S in lexicographic sorted order. Uses itertools.permutations
30.  [Minions Game](minions.py) - This program accepts a string S and lets 2 players play the minion game. It counts the number of substrings starting with vowels and consonants and prints the winner of the highest score.
31. [Deque](deque.py) - This program demonstrates the operations like append, appendleft, pop, popleft on a deque collection which can perform insert and remove operations on elements in queue. Uses deque from collections.
